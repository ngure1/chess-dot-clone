# ♟️ Chess Clone (Work in Progress)

A personal challenge project: building a **real-time chess platform** inspired by [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/)  
The goal is to explore **multiplayer systems, WebSockets, matchmaking, and scalable backend design**, while creating something fun and functional.

## 🎯 Purpose

## This project exists to **build something exciting and have fun while doing it**.

## ✨ Planned Features

- **Real-time Play** — send and receive moves instantly via WebSockets.
- **Online Opponents** — play against other users connected to the system.
- **Matchmaking by Rating** — pair players of similar strength for fair competition.
- **Multiple Formats** — support for blitz, rapid, bullet, and classical formats.
- **⏱Chess Clocks** — enforce time controls (countdowns synced with server).
- **Move History** — record and display past moves for replay/analysis.
- **Resilience** — reconnect seamlessly if a player drops mid-game.
- **Server-side Validation** — prevent cheating by validating all moves server-side.
